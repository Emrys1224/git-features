What I have learned about GitHub Features

GitHub is a free online service for managing code version and for collaborating with other developers for project deveopment

GitHub features the ff:
 * Posting of code documentation
 * The ability to collaborate with other developers
 * Serves as a platform for discussing issues related to the project
 * It can be connected to project management tools

Branches from the main code are used to add features or edits without affecting the main code. The code from the branch can then be reviewed before merging with the main branch. This is done through "pull request".

In the GitHub repository page there are a couple of sections such as Code, Issues, Pull Request, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, and Settings.
 * The Code section is where the files and codes of the selected branch can be found
 * The Issues section is where you can make discussions on a particular topic
 * The Pull Request section is where you post the codes that needs approval prior to merging with the main branch. Here the collaborators can review and comment about your code. On creating the title for pull requests there is a stard where a prefix is depending on the nature of the pull request; "feat:" is for features, "fix:" for resolving bugs, and "chore:" for code refactoring and clean up.
